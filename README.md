# MediumServerExample

In order to better demonstrate how to use MediumServer sdk, I made a universal application.

If you want to build applications locally, please pay attention to modifying Tools > `MediumHelper.cs`.

Replace your **Medium Application** info.

If you want to see the sdk info. Please check [here](https://github.com/Richasy/MediumServer)
